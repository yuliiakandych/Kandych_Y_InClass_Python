# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pic your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Phyton](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) 3 to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directore name</code> - and run the game.py file in the Python 3 Terminal window for mac / Linux.

**The rules are the same as the classic game:**  
  1. Paper covers Rock  
  2. Scissors cuts Paper  
  3. Rock smashes Scissors  

**_Choose your weapon wisely!_** 

The computer chooses first; just fillow the prompts.
